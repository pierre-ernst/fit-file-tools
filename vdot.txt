2Q / Plan A / First Marathon

A good rule of thumb is to increase VDOT one unit every four to six weeks.

Phase II
Amount of repetition running should not exceed 5% of the total weekly mileage

Phase III
Interval mileage should not exceed 8% of the total weekly mileage

The third quality session is a long run that should be no longer than 25% of weekly total mileage or 120 minutes, whichever is shorter

R pace in any single training session:
duration: 3% of weekly total running time) but should not do more than 20 minutes
